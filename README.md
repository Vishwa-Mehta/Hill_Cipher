## Hill Cipher
This is a Hill Cipher that encrypts a message in the form of string of numbers or characters as per the user's convinience.

There is a pre-defined encoding and decoding matrix that is multiplied with the matrix that is created from the entered text. The encrypted matrix is then converted to a string of numbers or characters and displayed. To decrypt we multiply the encypted matrix with the decoding matrix and then convert the obtained matrix back to text and display.

### Input:
1. Enter the text to be encrypted in the text box.
2. Check the box on the top if the encypted message is to be converted to characters instead of numbers.
3. Click on "Encrypt"
4. After the encypted message is displayed click on "Decrypt" to see the decypted message.

### Running the program:
1. Clone the repository
2. cd into the directory
3. Run the .html file.
